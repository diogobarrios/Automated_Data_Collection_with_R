These repo has the studies from the book:  
[Automated Data Collection with R: A Practical Guide to Web Scraping and Text Mining](http://www.ebook3000.com/upimg/allimg/141103/2014280.jpg)

Is a good reading book, introduces good concepts for one that isn't familiar with Internet protocols and similar stuff. Some of the exercises are outdated, so we have to manage to get the same result with new packages, (and this push for our brain!).   
The ```basics_webscrapping.r``` file has the majority of the exercises.  
Be friendly I'm stil learning and you'll certainly find some errors, and as we know it the errors is part of the learning process.   
So good luck and enjoy it!
